## Map
### Position
You can spot it position obviously, so this info is not needed
![MapPreview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhpsngum/img-src/master/MEMap.png)

*A blank 20x20 map with custom background image applied*

### Introduction
**PCs/Tablets:**
* Left-Click in any cell in the map to apply the asteroid to that cell
* Right-click in any cell to remove existing asteroid from that cell
* You can hold and drag your mouse for asteroid trails
* Use these keyboard shortcuts for navigation:

| Button | Moving direction |
| - | - |
| W / Arrow Up Button | Up |
| S / Arrow Down Button | Down |
| A / Arrow Left Button | Left |
| D / Arrow Right Button | Right |

**Mobile/Touch devices:**
* Touch in any cell in the map to apply the asteroid to that cell
* Touch and move with one finger for asteroid trails
* Touch and move with more than one finger to navigate in the map
## Advanced
(Beta)
### Custom Brush
Feel boring with the default brushes? Map Editor now provides the ability to create your own custom brush (with JavaScript (ECMAScript) a.k.a JS coding skill required).

You can submit your own custom brush through the feedback link so that it will has a chance to be added in the tool as default brushes.
#### Interface
![MECBInterface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhpsngum/img-src/master/MECBInterface.png)

Select the brush from the list

To create a new brush, click the create button ([Advanced Tab](#advanced-tab) option 2)

To edit the existing **custom** (not default) brush, select it and choose edit (option 3)

and to remove, click Remove (option 4)

Whenever you are editing or creating, it will show you the interface shown in the picture above with those infos:

(Notes: * means that it's a required section)

* **Name:** Brush name
* **Icon:** Brush icon with a Font Awesome Free name ([click here to search](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery))
* **Author:** Brush author
* **Code:**\* The code to be executed

Click **Save** to save the edits, **Cancel** to discard them
#### Features
**Note:**
* If the option does not reference to any tab, it's automatically referenced to [Advanced Tab](#advanced-tab)
* Coordinates perspective depends on its current context

Whenever user clicks or drags to one cell, brush commands will be fired with these parameters:

**`Cell` Object:** an object represent the selected cell, contains these values:
| Value | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| x | Integer | X Coordinate |
| y | Integer | Y Coordinate |
| size | Integer | Asteroid size to be applied to that cell (changable through the execution) |
| isRemoved | Boolean | `true` if user right-click into the cell (usually to remove the asteroid instantly) and vice versa |

**`StarblastMap` Object:** an object that contains most of the features, containing these properties:
* **`Asteroids`:** access asteroid properties and values:
  * **`set(x,y,size,type)`:** Set a cell at position (`x`;`y`) with asteroid size `size`
  * **`get(x,y,type)`:** Get asteroids size at a cell at position (`x`;`y`), returns a number representing the asteroid size at that cell

  *Note:*  
  * `x` and `y` should be restricted to the current coordinate perspective, defined in `type`:
  
  type 0: Map Index 0<=`x`,`y`<=9, should be integers

  type 1: Cartesian Coordinates, -`size`\*5<=`x`,`y`<=`size`\*5-1

  and 0<=`size`<=9, should be integers
  
  For example: `StarblastMap.Asteroids.set(0,8,3,0)` will set a cell at position (0;8) (in Map Index) with asteroid size 3

  and `StarblastMap.Asteroids.get(0,8,0)` will return 3 (in the next user action)
  * **`size`:** User's selection of predefined asteroid size range for randomization:

    **`min`**: minimum randomized size ([Edit Tab](#edit-tab) option 3a)

    **`max`**: maximum randomized size ([Edit Tab](#edit-tab) option 3b)
* **`size`:** A number represents the current map size
* **`Brush`:** An object represent some brush's properties:
  * **`size`:** brush size (option 5)
  * **`isRandomized`:** A boolean value represents the value from option 3c in [Edit Tab](#edit-tab)
* **`Utils`:** An object containing some functions that makes your life easier:
  * **`random(n)`:** Random an integer x with 0<=x<n
  * **`randomInRange(a,b)`:** Random an interger between a and b
### Errors & Warnings
![MECBErrors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bhpsngum/img-src/master/MECBErrors.png)
#### How to see them
Press F12 to open DevTools, navigate to Console Tab and everything will be displayed there like the image above
#### Execution Errors & Warnings (e.g first 3 errors)
These happen when your code runs failed or violate some rules, this can be any types.
#### Modification Errors & Warnings
These happens if Map Editor fails, partially or completely, to set/get a cell's data.
* **(Error)Invalid argument(s):** (e.g last 2 errors) Will come along with more detailed information, happens when you passed something wrong (usually non-numbers or numbers that excess the map size limit) into the function
* **(Warning)Found non-integer argument(s):** (e.g last 2 warnings) Detailed as above, usually happens when you passed non-integer values, but it doesn't excess the limit (e.g: 0.5;1.25). In that case the values will be modified:

  If it's the coordinates, it will be rounded **down** to the nearest integer, e.g 1.5 ---> 1; 6.9 ---> 6

  If it's an asteroids size, it will be rounded to the nearest interger, e.g 8.5 ---> 9, 6.1 ---> 6
#### Example: Made a simple brush
## Commonly asked questions

### 1. Why i can't see the asteroids in my map although the map isn't blank?
**Answer:** This problem occurs when your asteroid color is set to - intentionally or somehow unintentionally - the same color as the background.

**How to fix**: Navigate to the [Decoration Tab](#decoration-tab) and change the asteroid color (the first box from left to right).
### 2. Why my tool doesn't have "Copy Image" features although it's listed above?
**Answer:** Copy Image feature requires higher technic than text copying, if "Copy Image" button doesn't appear in your site, it means that your browser doesn't meet the requirements for this feature to operate (usually there's a notification in the Menu Bar if it happens).

**How to fix:** Switch to another browser, or, update your browser to the latest version.
### 3. Why can't I use the tool in IE (Internet Explorer)?
**Answer:** We've stopped supporting this browser since ME 2.0 as IE will be ~~killed~~stopped on 17 August, 2021 by Microsoft. If you're a fan of it, sorry about that :(

**How to fix:** Switch to another browser.
